Drain and cool completely. Hard boil eggs — cover with cold water, bring to boil, cook 10 minutes, transfer to ice water, peel and chop. Whisk mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and sugar together. Fold potatoes, eggs, celery, and red onion into dressing. Season generously with salt and pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Sprinkle paprika over top before serving.'},

Cook bacon until crispy and crumble. Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, and sugar together. Combine broccoli, bacon, red onion, cranberries, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl.

Combine with red onion and parsley in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, and oregano. Pour over vegetables and toss. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit 10 minutes at room temperature before serving so the vegetables release their juices into the dressing.'},
      {id: 'vs5', name: 'Three Bean Salad', servings: '6 servings', ingredients: ['1 can (14 oz) green beans, drained', '1 can (14 oz) kidney beans, drained and rinsed', '1 can (14 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed', '½ red onion, finely diced', '½ green bell pepper, finely diced', '¼ cup fresh parsley', '½ cup apple cider vinegar', '¼ cup olive oil', '3 tbsp sugar', 'Salt and pepper'], prep: 'Drain and rinse all beans.
